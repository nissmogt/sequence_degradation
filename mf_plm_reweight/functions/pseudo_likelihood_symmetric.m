function [pseudoNLL,g] = pseudo_likelihood_symmetric(w,Y,weights,N,q,edges,lambdah,lambdaJ)
%This function evaluates the full pseudolikelihood as a sum of marginal likelihoods g_r.
%Unlike in the paper's formulation, the regularization terms are here included in g_r.

%Prepare inputs to each g_r; g_r does not take all parameters h and J, but only h_r and J_r (={J_ri}_[i!=r]).
h=reshape(w(1:q*N),N,q); J=reshape(w(q*N+1:end),q,q,N*(N-1)/2);
J_rs=zeros(q^2*(N-1),N); %Matrix in which to store couplings for input to g_r (with column r containing J_r).
for r=1:N
   ls1=(edges(:,2)==r);ls2=edges(:,1)==r; %Extract all pairs that have the position index r in them.
   J_rs(1:q^2*(r-1),r)=reshape(permute(J(:,:,ls1),[2 1 3]),q^2*(r-1),1); 
   J_rs(q^2*(r-1)+1:end,r)=reshape(J(:,:,ls2),q^2*(N-r),1);
%The reason for the permutations above: 
%For J_ij as stored in the variable J, i is always <j. But, in g_r the first AA index is always associated with position r, as in J_ri(sigma_r,sigma_i). So, if r>i sigma_r and sigma_i must be swapped.
end

%Evaluate all g_r.
f=zeros(1,N);
grad=zeros(q+q^2*(N-1),N);
parfor r=1:N
    [f(r) grad(:,r)]=g_r([h(r,:)';J_rs(:,r)],Y,weights,N,q,lambdah,lambdaJ/2,r);	%Since a regularization term for J_ij is included in both g_i and g_j, we divide the coupling-regularization strength by 2 to compensate for double counting.
